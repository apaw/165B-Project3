Using the nodes from our TriangleCounter/NodeIterator on Hadoop, we then used a script that:

1) replaced the commas present in our original output file with spaces
2) ran the wordcount job on our modified file with Hadoop, to count the number of instances of each node
3) sorted the output of the wordcount file by the number of instances for each node

The generated and sorted file is also included as node_counts.txt.
